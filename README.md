# My Portfolio

<h1><a href="https://portfolio-react-two-lac.vercel.app/">Portfolio</a></h1>
<p>This is my portfolio where I talk about me, my projects, my skills, etc. License MIT</p>

## Credits

I want to give credits to these websites [tabler icons](https://tabler.io/icons) and [svgl](https://svgl.vercel.app/) from Pheralb,
where I used those icons to make my Portfolio prettier, both have MIT License which means legit use for private and comercial purposes.

Also the fonts I have used in this website are from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). I also recommend using Fontsource for
using font types.
